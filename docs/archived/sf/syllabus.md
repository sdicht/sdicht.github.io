## Course Description

This course is a survey of science fiction in English from the late 19th century to the present. The course pays special attention to the oscillations of the genre’s status, from respectable work of the imagination (“speculative fiction”) to despised escapist entertainment (“pulp”) and back, before becoming a spectrum of subgenres (cyberpunk, weird, “literary,” etc.). The interpretation of science fiction texts is thus set within the history of science fiction readers, publishers, and writers, from the earliest SF pulps to massive “convergence culture” science fiction that straddles books, film, TV, and internet fandom. Readings are short stories (taken from the Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction), paired with selected academic articles.

## Objectives

- Introduce the history of English-language science fiction literature in terms of its diverse forms, themes, and publication media.
