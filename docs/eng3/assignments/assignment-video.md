## Slide Design Requirements

### :art: Visual Elements
Maintain a consistent theme throughout that matches your universe's aesthetic. Use character images (screenshots, artwork, or your own drawings) with clear, readable fonts (don't go too crazy with the fonts). Include slide numbers for easy reference during feedback.

### :page_facing_up: Text Guidelines
Keep slides to maximum 3-4 bullet points per slide when listing items. Highlight key modal verbs in bold or color, but integrate grammar structures naturally rather than obviously forcing them. Ensure character names and universe details are accurate.

### :sound: Audio Quality
Practice clear speech and pronunciation. Make character voices distinct from your narrator voice. Maintain an appropriate pace without rushing, and deliver naturally rather than reading directly from slides.

## Character Performance During Recording

### :dancers: Presentation Style
Keep your face visible in the video (not just voice-over). Use gestures and expressions that match your character. Costume or styling elements are optional but encouraged. Deliver with confidence - believe in your character's authority. 👩‍⚖️ 

!!! tip
    Look at the camera occasionally when giving advice, not just reading slides. Use natural gestures without exaggerating, but remain expressive. Maintain distinct character voices and switch voices clearly when presenting problems AS other characters. Pause when needed to organize thoughts or transition between segments.

### :book: Grammar Integration
Highlight key modal verbs using your mouse or cursor on slides. Read character quotes aloud to demonstrate pronunciation and emotion. Explain while showing rather than just reading slides. Show your analysis process: "When I consider this problem, I think..." Maintain energy throughout - your enthusiasm shows in your character performance.

Don't announce grammar explicitly - weave modal verbs naturally into advice. Vary sentence length by mixing complex and simple structures. Use modal progression to show escalating urgency across cases. Let your character's personality drive your modal choices.

!!! tip
    Create a distinct voice for your advice-giving character (tone, pace, mannerisms) and use a different voice when presenting problems AS other characters. Maintain consistent personality - consider how your character would really respond. Use appropriate emotional range: serious for crises, gentle for minor problems.

## :vhs: Video Examples by Character Type

### If Your Character is Sherlock Holmes (logical, direct):
> The evidence clearly indicates that you must confront this situation. If you examine the facts logically, you will see the solution. Those who ignore evidence often find themselves in frustrating situations.

### If Your Character is Wonder Woman (heroic, inspiring):
> You should remember your inner strength - I have seen it in battle. This challenge might seem overwhelming, but you're supposed to fight for what's right, aren't you? If you were afraid of nothing, you wouldn't be truly brave.

### If Your Character is Hermione Granger (studious, caring):
> You should research this thoroughly first - so would any intelligent person. I'm worried about your hasty decisions, but I'm also excited about your potential. You must think before acting, mustn't you?
