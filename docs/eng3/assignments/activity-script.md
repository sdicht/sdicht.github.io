# Character Script & Reflection Activity 🧙‍♂️ ✍️

Objective: Write and perform in-character scripts, then reflect individually using multiple grammar structures.  


## Step 1: Choose Your Character
- Pick one fictional character
- Decide on a short scene or situation for your character.


## Step 2: Pair Script Practice (Mini-Scripts)

Instructions: In pairs, write 2 mini-scripts (3–4 sentences each).  

Must include:  
  - 2 modals  
  - 1 conditional  
  - 1 relative clause  
  - 1 reported speech  

| Mini-Script | Sentence | Grammar Focus |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Script 1 | “If I could ___, I would ___.” | Conditional |
|  | “The person who ___ was very ___.” | Relative clause |
|  | “My friend told me ___.” | Reported speech |
|  | “I might/can/should ___.” | Modal |
| Script 2 | “If I ___, I would ___.” | Conditional |
|  | “The item which ___ helped me ___.” | Relative clause |
|  | “The teacher said that ___.” | Reported speech |
|  | “I must/might/can ___.” | Modal |


## Step 3: Individual Reflection

Instructions: Write 3–4 sentences as your character, integrating as many grammar structures as possible:  

Grammar checklist:  
  
  - Modals  
  - Conditionals  
  - Agreement patterns  
  - Question tags  
  - Relative clauses  
  - Reported speech  
  - Gerunds/Infinitives  
  - Still/Yet/Already  

| Grammar Point | Sentence Starter / Prompt | Example / Hint |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Modals / Conditionals | “If I could ___, I would ___.” | (something your character wants or plans) |
| Modals / Conditionals | “I should have ___, but I ___.” | (regret or missed action) |
| Agreement Patterns | “Everyone in the group ___, and we all ___.” | (reaction or action) |
| Agreement Patterns | “Neither the villain nor the hero ___.” | (verb/action) |
| Question Tags | “The mission is dangerous, ___?” | (isn’t it? / doesn’t it?) |
| Relative Clauses | “The person who ___ was very ___.” | (describe someone) |
| Relative Clauses | “I used the item which ___.” | (describe effect) |
| Reported Speech | “My friend told me ___.” | (advice or warning) |
| Reported Speech | “The teacher said that ___.” | (instruction or info) |
| Gerund / Infinitive | “I enjoy ___ing.” | (activity) |
| Gerund / Infinitive | “I decided to ___.” | (decision/action) |
| Still / Yet / Already | “I haven’t ___ yet.” | (unfinished task) |
| Still / Yet / Already | “I have ___ already.” | (completed task) |
| Still / Yet / Already | “They are still ___ing.” | (ongoing action) |


## Step 4: Combine & Polish
- Take your sentences from Step 3 and link them into a short paragraph.  
- Try to use at least 5–6 grammar points naturally.  
- Make sure the paragraph flows in character and is understandable on its own.  


### Example Paragraph (First-Person, Sherlock Holmes)

| Sentence | Grammar Points |
|----------|----------------|
| “If I could examine the crime scene more carefully, I would have found the missing evidence.” | Conditional |
| “The detective who helped me was very clever.” | Relative clause |
| “Lestrade told me not to touch the crime scene.” | Reported speech |
| “I haven’t solved the case yet.” | Still/Yet |
| “I enjoy investigating strange clues, and I decided to follow the suspect.” | Gerund/Infinitive |


!!! tip
    - Use the tables as scaffolds; you do not need to write exactly what is suggested.  
    - Try to integrate multiple grammar points in each sentence when possible.  
    - Spend time polishing your paragraph so it reads naturally in character.
