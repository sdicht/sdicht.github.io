# Activity 1: Katherine Mansfield’s “The Garden Party”

## Context and Introduction
You've now read several stories from the late Victorian and early modernist periods - Joyce's "Araby" and "Eveline," and Hardy's "On the Western Circuit." Next week we'll encounter T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" and World War I poetry. Today's story, "The Garden Party" by Katherine Mansfield, demonstrates the transition from Victorian certainties to modernist consciousness through the lens of class awareness and personal awakening.

Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923) was a New Zealand-born writer who became a key figure in the development of the modern short story. Mansfield's stories are notable for their nuanced observations of gender, class, and family alliances, especially in the aftermath of World War I. "The Daughters of the Late Colonel" describes women who are remnants of an earlier era, unable to break free of the limitations that Victorian patriarchy placed upon their sex even after their tyrannical father has passed away. Helpless and provincial, Constantia and Josephine have never been allowed any scope for intellectual development, a situation that is comically highlighted when their young nephew comes to visit.

Similarly, the young female protagonist of "The Garden Party" is circumscribed by another kind of cultural limitation, one that she is only just beginning to wake up to. As Laura's family readies itself for an elaborate outdoor party, complete with band, they learn that a neighboring working-class man has died in an accident not far from their home, leaving an impoverished wife and several children on their own. Although Laura assumes that the festivities will be canceled, she discovers that others feel differently. The conflict between her dawning awareness of the injustice of class disparities and her family's stubborn refusal to let the misfortunes of the poor disturb the tranquillity of their privileged existence form the drama of this piece. Mansfield's touch is subtle and restrained, encouraging careful reading. 
 
## Your Task (Work in pairs)
After reading [“The Garden Party,”](../readings/mansfield-garden.pdf) you and your partner will complete the following analytical activities. Write 2-3 pages total, supporting all observations with specific textual evidence.



## Question 1

**Choose ONE of the following scenes to analyze in detail:**

### Option A: The Workmen Scene (opening)
- How does Laura behave when talking to the workmen about the marquee placement?
- What does her copying of “her mother’s tone” reveal about her uncertainty?
- Find evidence showing Laura’s conflicted feelings about class distinctions

### Option B: The Hat Scene (middle)
- Analyze Laura’s reaction when she sees herself wearing the new hat
- What internal conflict does this moment reveal?
- How does the hat symbolize her struggle between social conscience and family loyalty?

**Your analysis should include:** 

- 2-3 specific quotes with page references 
- Explanation of what these details reveal about Laura’s character 
– Discussion of how this scene shows her developing consciousness

## Question 2
Create a comparison chart showing different attitudes toward the working class:

| Character | Attitude toward Working Class | Evidence from Text |
|---|---|---|
| Laura | | |
| Mother | | |
| Jose | | |
| Laurie | | |

Then write a paragraph analyzing: **What does Mansfield suggest about how class differences are maintained in this society?** Use your chart evidence to support your argument.

## Question 3
The story ends with Laura’s incomplete statement and Laurie’s response: 
 “Isn’t life—” she stammered. 
“Isn’t it, darling?” said Laurie.

**Work together to answer:** 

-  What do you think Laura was going to say? Give 2-3 possible completions of her sentence. 
- Has Laura completely rejected her family’s values by the end? Find evidence for your answer. 
- Does Laurie truly understand his sister? What does his response suggest?

Write one paragraph explaining what you think Laura has learned and how much she has actually changed.

## Question 4
In a final paragraph, compare Laura’s moment of realization to the epiphany in either Joyce’s “Araby” or “Eveline.” Consider: 

- What triggers the character’s moment of awareness? 
- How complete is their understanding? 
- What do they do (or not do) as a result?
