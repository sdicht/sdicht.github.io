# Assignment 3: Hanif Kureishi's "My Son the Fanatic"

## Context and Introduction
Hanif Kureishi, the son of a Pakistani father and En­glish mother, grew up in London, where he experienced racial taunts from peers and teachers alike. He later drew upon his observations of cultural conflict in stories, plays, and screenplays, many of which ­ were made into successful films. In “My Son the Fanatic,” Kureishi turns his attention to the topic of fundamentalist Islam and the fascination it holds for some of Britain’s culturally estranged youth, often children of immigrants from Britain’s former colonies. Commenting on this subject in an essay written a de­cade earlier, he says, “I saw the taking up of Islam as an aberration, a desperate fantasy of worldwide black brotherhood; it was a symptom of extreme alienation” (["You will Always be a Paki"](../readings/kureishi-paki.pdf)). “My Son the Fanatic” illustrates this kind of cultural alienation in the character of Ali, the son of a Punjabi immigrant now working as a cab driver in En­gland. In the course of the story, Ali becomes increasingly devout, turning against his father whom he disparages because he has adopted Western ways. Ali’s father, Parvez, becomes more and more frustrated, unable to understand or deal with his son’s newly aloof demeanor and religious devotion. As the story builds to its violent conclusion, the two have reversed traditional parent–­child roles and Ali lords his moral superiority over his father with the cutting words, “So who’s the fanatic now?”
 
## Your Task (Work in pairs)
After reading [“My Son the Fanatic,”](../readings/kureishi-fanatic.pdf) you and your partner will answer the following questions. Aim for 1,000-1,200 words total, supporting all observations with specific textual evidence.

### Questions

1. Compare the depiction of Western and Islamic values and beliefs in “My Son the Fanatic.” What is it about his father’s habits and lifestyle that Ali objects to? Why does Ali toss out his stylish clothes, his guitar, and so on? Why, in his view, are these things in conflict with Islamist beliefs?
2. Why does Parvez enjoy living in En­gland? What kinds of activities and relationships make it possible for him to feel comfortable there? How does his view of Islam differ from his son’s, and why?
3. Read Kureishi’s [“You Will Always Be a Paki”](../readings/kureishi-paki.pdf), paying par­tic­u­lar attention to the climate of racism he describes. What kind of experiences might Ali have had that would contribute to his cultural alienation? What passages in the story indicate that Ali feels estranged from white British society?
4. What role does Bettina play in this story? Why is she significant to both father and son, but in completely different ways?
5. Trace the reversal of father–­son roles that occurs during “My Son the Fanatic.” Why does Ali gain confidence during the story and his father lose moral ground?
