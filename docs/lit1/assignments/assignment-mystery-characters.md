Ther was a man with a forked berd,
In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat;
His resons he spak ful solempnely,
Sownynge alwey th' encrees of his wynnyng.

So estatly was he of his governaunce
With his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunce.
For sothe he was a worthy man with alle,

Ther was a man with us in that place,
That hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face,
For saucefleem he was, with eyen narwe.

He was a gentil harlot and a kynde;
A bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde.
He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn
A good felawe to have his concubyn
A twelf month, and excuse hym atte fulle

Of studie took he moost cure and moost heede.
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche.
