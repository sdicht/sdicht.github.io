Create a 10-minute video presentation analyzing how Shakespeare uses structure in *Othello*, applying concepts from Chapter 5 "Structure" from *The Cambridge Introduction to Shakespeare* by Emma Smith to the play. This is a group assignment for 1-3 students.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Analyze Shakespeare's structural techniques in *Othello*
- Apply theoretical concepts about genre, pacing, and dramatic structure to a specific play
- Practice academic presentation skills in English
- Demonstrate understanding of how structure creates meaning in Renaissance drama

## Key Concepts

### 1. Find the "Heart of the Play"
Identify what you consider the central/pivotal scene in *Othello* and explain why this scene is crucial to the play's development. 

### 2. Genres (Choose 1-2)
- How does *Othello* negotiate between tragedy and other genres?
- Are there moments where the play could become comedy? When does it definitively become tragedy?
- How does Othello compare to the "tragedy vs. comedy" characteristics in Table 5.1?

### 3. Structural Techniques (Choose 2-3)
- How do contrasting scenes create meaning?
- What important events happen offstage? Why?
- How does Shakespeare control when events happen?
