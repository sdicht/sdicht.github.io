# Assignment 1: Character Analysis (The Knight up to the Friar)

For each quote, a) Translate into Modern English using your own words and b) Answer the questions.

## The Prioress 

Context: A prioress (nun) should be humble, help the poor, and focus on spiritual matters. But look at what 

Quote 1
```
She wolde wepe, if that she saugh a mous 
Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde. 
Of smale houndes hadde she that she fedde 
With rosted flessh, or milk and wastel-breed 
```

- What does this tell us about her priorities? 

Quote 2
```
Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar 
A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene, 
And theron heng a brooch of gold ful sheene, 
On which ther was first write a crowned A, 
And after Amor vincit omnia. 
```

- Should a nun wear expensive jewelry? 
- What does "Love conquers all" mean in a religious vs. secular context? 

## The Monk
Context: Monks took vows of poverty, obedience, and staying in the monastery. They should follow Saint Benedict's rules, for instance. 

```
The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit, 
By cause that it was old and somdel streit, 
This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace, 
And heeld after the newe world the space. 
```

- What should a monk's attitude be toward ancient religious rules? 
- What does the term newe world suggest about his priorities? 
- How does this connect to medieval concerns about Church corruption? 

## The Friar 

Context: Friars took vows of poverty and were supposed to help the poor through charity. They should hear confessions and give spiritual guidance, not seek profit. 

Quote 1
```
Ful swetely herde he confessioun, 
And plesaunt was his absolucioun. 
He was an esy man to yeve penaunce, 
Ther as he wiste to have a good pitaunce. 
```

- What's wrong with giving "easy penance" when you expect a good payment?
  
Quote 2
```
In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan 
So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage. 
He hadde maad ful many a mariage 
Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost. 
```

- Why would a friar need to arrange marriages "at his own cost"? 
- What does this suggest about his relationships with young women? 

## The Knight 
Context: One of the few pilgrims described without irony by Chaucer, representing the medieval Christian ideal, with the Crusades as legitimate holy wars.

```
A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, 
That fro the tyme that he first bigan 
To ryden out, he loved chivalrye, 
Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye. 
```

- Even though he is violent and kills people in holy wars, he is the ideal Christian soldier. He sets up an ideal of perfectibilty to help us see how the others fall short. Is there any evidence for this in the text?

## Synthesis

Choose the Prioress, Monk, or Friar and explain how Chaucer uses contrast to reveal character. Think about: 

- What they should be vs. what they are 
- What they say vs. what they do 
- Surface appearance vs. reality
