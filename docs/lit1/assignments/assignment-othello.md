## Essay Prompt

After reading Smith's chapter on structure, choose the ideas from her analysis that you find most useful for understanding how Othello is constructed as a tragedy. Write an essay that demonstrates how Smith's approach to dramatic structure helps us understand what makes Othello an effective tragedy.

### Length and Format

### Smith's Key Concepts to Use
- Tragedy vs. Comedy characteristics (Table 5.1)

- The temptation scene as structural center
- "Showing vs. telling" techniques
- Genre as "negotiation" rather than fixed category

### Moments in Othello to Analyze

- Act III, Scene 3 - the temptation scene transformation
- The handkerchief plot development
- Public scenes vs. private scenes
- The final bedroom scene
- How truth is revealed in Act V

### Questions to Explore
- What makes Othello a tragedy rather than just a sad story?
- How does Shakespeare structure Othello's transformation from hero to murderer?
- How does Shakespeare control audience knowledge vs. character knowledge?
- Why does the order of scenes matter?

### Smith quotations example
> Smith argues that "Shakespeare's structure is therefore always dynamic rather than inert, actively produced from moment to moment" (107).

### Othello quotations examples
> Iago reveals his manipulative nature: "I am not what I am" (1.1.65).

Longer quotations (use for 3+ lines):
> Othello's final speech reveals his self-awareness:
```
    Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,
    Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak
    Of one that loved not wisely, but too well (5.2.341-343).
```
